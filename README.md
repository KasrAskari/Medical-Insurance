# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting individual medical insurance costs using demographic and health-related features. By leveraging machine learning models, the repository provides insights into how factors such as age, BMI, and smoking status affect insurance premiums.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and correlations between features and insurance costs.  
- **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict insurance charges.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:  
- **Age**: Age of the individual.  
- **Sex**: Gender (male/female).  
- **BMI**: Body mass index.  
- **Children**: Number of dependents.  
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker.  
- **Region**: Geographical region.  
- **Charges**: Medical insurance costs (target variable).
